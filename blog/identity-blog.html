        My core personal values are authenticity, kindness and curiosity.<br>Being myself is one of the values I hold
        closest to me. I find it hard to describe who I am but I can feel it in my body when it is or isn‚Äôt right. Who I
        am is constantly evolving so I don‚Äôt like to hold on to my identity too tightly so I am free to change and try
        new things, it also gives me the ability to let different people and situations bring out different parts of me
        while still feeling true to myself.

      <p>If we can share anything with anyone we interact with throughout the day it should be kindness. I like to
        remind myself that every person is a person - on the surface, of course they are! But more than that, everyone
        has thoughts, feelings and their own lives going on so extending kindness to them can at least ensure you are
        not making things harder for them and at best make their day a little better. I try to make it my first reaction
        to any situation, if you pass someone on the street, if someone hasn‚Äôt been able to help you with something,
        they are complaining about something - it doesn‚Äôt matter - treat them with kindness. This is sometimes hard to
        remember in the Auckland traffic though! I also have to remind myself to extend this to myself - it is a work in
        progress üôÉ

        Learn new things, it‚Äôs fun! Read books, talk to others, listen to podcasts, try new things, practice skills,
        watch videos! Skip around through topics, deep diving when you feel like it. It helps me understand other
        people‚Äôs perspectives, gives me context about how things work together in the world and why things happen.

      <p><span class="green-heading">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you
          weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you
          took.</span></p>
      <p>I had to decide whether or not to support a set of work which was causing harm to a community. I did not want
        to support it at all as the work was so at odds with my beliefs but I was scared of the repercussions to myself
        and the organisation. To be honest I tried to ignore to start but I realised that that was in fact a decision in
        itself - that by not doing anything I was part of the problem and was continuing to let it cause harm and I
        couldn‚Äôt let that happen when it went against my values so much. I started by reading books on the subject,
        listening to more voices in the community and talking it through with my partner. I decided to stop supporting
        the work by telling my boss about why I thought it was important we didn‚Äôt support it and I asked for some help
        in dissolving the relationship. She listened and agreed with the points I had prepared and we were able to make
        a plan together about how to stop supporting the work and the issue was closed by the end of the day. It taught
        me that indecision is a decision, standing up for what I believe in is so important and that if I think
        something is wrong I‚Äôm probably not the only one.</p>
      <p class="green-heading">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</p>
      <p>I haven‚Äôt always felt like I was able to be myself, and leaned in to pretending to be whoever other people
        thought I was. Especially when other people would put labels on who I was or wasn‚Äôt it made me feel like who I
        thought I was wasn‚Äôt valid.

        In recent years I have become a lot more comfortable with who I am and a big part of that comes from learning
        more about my MƒÅori culture and understanding that because I have MƒÅori whakapapa I am MƒÅori (not part or insert
        percentage here MƒÅori, but MƒÅori). This idea made me realise I can be a whole lot of different things and I am
        not partially any of them, I am all of them. Even if they are contradictory.</p>
      <p class="green-heading">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
      </p>
      <p>My biggest strengths in my career so far are the ability to be flexible, analytical, curious and solve problems
        for others. Not only do I think these are my biggest strengths but they are what I like doing the most. Being
        flexible means I could try out lots of different tasks and positions and meant I got to learn lots of new things
        which helped serve my curiosity. Seeing how things fit and work together brings me a lot of joy so I would spend
        time creating systems to make different parts easier, more automated and more enjoyable for others and
        myself.<br>My biggest limitation when it comes to my career (and probably life) is that I struggle with being
        assertive. It comes in many forms, from not speaking up for my rights, not asking for help, questioning my
        decisions, letting people break my boundaries, breaking my own boundaries, feeling like I had to do things
        people expected of me... just to name a few. I think this comes partially from always trying to be empathetic
        and trying to understand where others are coming from but often to my own detriment. Time and time again when I
        did personality tests or asked people what they thought my strengths are they would say empathy which I agree
        with to a point but depending on how it manifests it can also be a weakness for me so I am learning how to use
        it for good. <br>It is something I really want to work on and leaving my job last year and deciding to apply for
        Dev were some of my first big steps toward this. I was doing these things for me - no one else and I feel really
        good about it üòä</p>
      <p class="green-heading">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they
        might intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
      <p>I think all of these strengths will help me learn at Dev - because they will point me toward the type of work I
        want to be doing and have helped me in all of my previous learning situations. Especially wanting to stay
        curious - I love a deep dive but equally my curiosity tends to make me a dabbler - learn something intently and
        then move on to something else.<br>And in terms of not being assertive... I‚Äôm taking baby steps but I am worried
        that it will stop me from reaching out if I need help. I‚Äôm dedicated to practicing being assertive everyday and
        as my friend said, the goal of 2022 is to pretend you have the confidence of a straight, cis, middle-aged, white
        man.</p>
      <p class="green-heading">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they
        were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>
      <p>At work there was a time where I was trying to train someone new and had a lot of resistance from them when it
        came to them following instructions to get stuff done. I tried teaching them in ways they indicated would be
        more helpful, sitting with them when they needed, getting other people in the office to teach them things, found
        tasks that they enjoyed doing and suited their skills and writing up notes for them to follow but it wasn‚Äôt
        particularly effective. I was exhausted from training them and someone else at the same time while also trying
        to learn/do a new job myself so my patience wore thin and my ability to show empathy was lower than it could
        have been. If I could relive that situation I would first have asked my manager for extra help so I wasn‚Äôt so
        stretched and had more emotional energy to spend helping. Then I would offer support rather than help, meet them
        in in the middle, offer more of a dialogue about why they were struggling, let them get things wrong and not
        hold them to the standard of the previous person in that role. I would try these now because I think starting a
        new job can be stressful and getting things wrong can get you down so offering support rather help would help
        with confidence and skills will come in time.</p>
