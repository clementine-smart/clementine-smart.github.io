      <span class="green-heading">Long-term goals:</span><br>I don‚Äôt have a long-term career pathway mapped out right now, rather some ideas of things I would like to try at some stage when the time is right. By attending Dev Academy I am working towards getting an entry level job as a developer. I would really like to be a little cog in a team/company. Other things I would like to build my skills up to try are working remotely, either for a company or for myself so I can take some time out of Auckland and work as a developer in an industry I have other interests in - like books, data, food or art/design. But I‚Äôm just starting out in my learning so don‚Äôt know what wonderful things I will be introduced to that might take my fancy so keeping my mind open üòä

    <p><span class="green-heading">Strengths and limitations in relation to learning</span><br>
      In terms of learning my strengths are curiosity, empathy, being analytical, willing to try new things and being flexible. These have all helped me in the past when learning new skills and I will continue fostering them at Dev in order to learn as much as I can. My weaknesses are not standing up for myself and not asking for help when I need support. This can lead to me doubting myself and feeling alone. I have especially been working on being more open with people and letting them know when I might need some help or just letting people know i am having a hard time - it is a work in process but I am proud of myself for working on it. I also struggle when I feel like I am not keeping up with people‚Äôs expectations. I need to actively remind myself that I don‚Äôt know what other people are thinking and that I am projecting those expectations. I need to focus only on keeping up with myself and my own expectations I have set out for myself.

    <p><span class="green-heading">Managing workload with myself and others</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I will make plans before the start of each week and the before the start of each day - reflecting at the end of each. I find planning before the day starts helps me feel settled for the day and ready to get started</li>
      <li>Showing up and doing the work - being in class shows respect to not only myself but to my other students and facilitators</li>      
      <li>Listen to others and respect their boundaries. Our lives are all different and how we work, think and react to situations is different so really listening with good intentions is the best place to start any interaction</li>
      <li>I will take breaks, stretch and go outside - find sunshine and drink good coffee üòä</li>
      <li>I don‚Äôt have any other commitments during class time and I have made sure that during bootcamp I have not made any other plans so I focus all of my attention on it. I need to look after my cat - it doesn‚Äôt take much, just need to feed him morning and night and make sure to play with him in the evening to tire him out so he is settled through the night</li>
      <li>I have whƒÅnau dinner once a week on a Sunday. They are really important to my wellbeing so would like to prioritise them. But to make sure I feeling fresh for the new week I will make sure I am all ready for the week before I go and make sure I am home by 10pm</li>
      <li>If things are building up and starting to get to me I will first: Stop, breathe, stretch and go outside. Sometimes a break and a bit of perspective can really help</li>
      <li>Break down what I have going on so it doesn‚Äôt just feel like a wall of work - write out a list of what I have on, what are priorities and what would be nice to get to if I have time</li>
      <li>Talk to someone, whether that is another student or facilitator, someone I feel safe sharing with and let them know what is going on - listen and take on any ideas to lighten the load (either physically or mentally)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="green-heading">Asking for help</span><br>
      If I need technical help I will first talk to my fellow students, see if anyone else is having the same problems and see if we can find solutions together or if people can share their expertise in certain subjects. I will keep an open line of communication with my facilitator, friends and whƒÅnau. By talking about how I am going on a regular basis, both the good and the bad, it will be easier for me to reach out if I need support when things are difficult because it won‚Äôt feel like a momentous thing to do but part of a regular routine.</p>
      <p><span class="green-heading">Expectations</span><br>
        I think expectations are a two way street, so I expect these things of myself and in return from the facilitation team. I will listen, be respectful and kind and would hope for the same in return. I would expect support to guide me to find my own solutions to problems and just lend an ear if I am having a hard time. I would also hope for feedback to help me focus on areas where I need to do the most work - in both technical and core elements of the course.</p>
