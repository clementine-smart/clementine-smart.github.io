      Emotional Intelligence is being able to recognise thoughts and emotions and then use your understanding of them to manage yourself and interactions with others. It isn’t just one thing - but rather a collection of skills - so you might be naturally stronger in some areas than others. Just like any skills though you can practice them to get better and so they come more naturally.

  <ul>
    <li>Self-awareness - this is a multi-layered skill and can start with being aware of your emotions and thoughts, being aware of how those emotions and thoughts affect your actions and then using that information to make more informed decisions on how to act/react. Some ways you can practice are through mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy techniques, journalling, and learning more about emotional intelligence.</li>
    <li>Empathy - this is basically having self-awareness for other people. Understanding that other people have different thoughts, emotions, views and experiences than you so the way they think and act might not line up with your expectations of them. Practice comes through active listening, trying to be non-judgemental, giving people the benefit of the doubt, accepting feedback, letting people disagree with you, and paying attention to others offering support to name a few.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>
      By first noticing and understanding your and others thoughts and emotions you can then regulate and control them to then manage them and your actions.

      In comparison, IQ is the measure of your cognitive abilities like reasoning, logic, pattern recognition and problem solving. IQ is measured through standardised tests and it returns a quantitative result whereas EQ (Emotional Quotient) is mostly measured through self-assessment tests which leave them open to interpretation from the taker. Different circumstances require you to pull from either or both of these skill sets for example working in a team to solve a problem, it is important to use logic and reasoning but also self awareness about how you work with others and your ability to work in the team come down to your emotional intelligence skills.

      Emotional intelligence is important because it guides the way we interact with others and how we act in all situations. The benefits of strengthening emotional intelligence can include: better wellbeing, decreased stress, stronger connection to friends and whānau, increased sense of worth and then on a more career focussed level it can help you work in a team, help with motivation, increase leadership abilities, and develop a strong social network. It’s important because our relationships to other people are important and our emotional intelligence affects those relationships so it is something we can and should practice every day.
